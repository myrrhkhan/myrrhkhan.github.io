        <p className="">
          Welcome to my personal site! I’m Myrrh Khan (he/him), and I’m
          currently studying CS at WPI with a minor in Robotics Engineering, and
          will graduate in May 2025.
        </p>
        <p className="">
          This site is a work in progress, and it’s something I’ll work on often
          as I have other projects, but I still hope you enjoy :)
        </p>
