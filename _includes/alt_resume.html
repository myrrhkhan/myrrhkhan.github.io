      <h2>UAV-UGV Project</h2>
      <p>
        Completed with 3 other students as part of WPI's year-long Major
        Qualifying Project. Sponsored by Draper.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were tasked with designing and creating a system to land UAVs onto
        UGVs. Such systems are ideal for search-and-rescue operations, mapping,
        and other crucial operations, and knew that our project had the
        potential to save lives. In our background research, we found that many
        existing solutions are overcomplicated and unreliable, so we designed a
        passive, 3D-printed landing mechanism, ensuring the UAV could land in
        any orientation and that costs were low.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enabled communication between the UAV and the UGV via two ESP-32
        microcontrollers and WiFi. By creating an object-oriented codebase in
        C++, I ensured that it would be easy to change state machine
        transitions, allowing future projects to change landing detection
        methods with ease.
      </p>
      <p>
        We presented our project at Draper's annual Capstone Symposium and won
        first place. We experienced many obstacles, including building the UAV,
        ensuring communication was synced properly, and designing the landing
        mechanism. We later learned that the project almost didn't happen
        because of concerns that it would be too difficult for students, so to
        overcome these hurdles and win first place felt incredibly
        accomplishing.

      <h2>Violet: Handwriting-to-Text Converter</h2>
      <p>
        Violet is a handwriting-to-text converter that won an Honorable Mention
        for GoatHacks 2024. Tired of typing out my notes, I wanted to start
        handwriting them, as handwriting is better for memory. However, I still
        wanted electronic versions available, and the only handwriting-to-text
        solution I could find was to switch note-taking apps, or using my hefty
        Windows tablet that could fry an egg as soon as you heated it up. There
        was no universal option for all operating systems, so Violet was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though I had zero experience with any of these languages and frameworks
        I used, I decided that building Violet would be the perfect opportunity
        to learn them. Svelte is a newer framework that offers a compiler,
        allowing for significantly less boilerplate and easier-to-read syntax
        compared to React, which did not have a compiler at the time. Rust is
        incredibly memory-safe compared to C/C++, so I wanted to learn it as I
        anticipate more and more companies will adopt it. Tauri is an
        alternative to Electron, a framework for making desktop apps using a
        stripped Chromium browser, makiing it easy to use the same frontend code
        for desktop apps and websites. Tauri uses a native webview rather than a
        Chromium browser, making boot times quicker.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire project took me two days to complete, winning me an Honorable
        Mention (and being the only winner who worked solo). I won a 12-pack of
        Celsius energy drinks, which I happily distributed to random people.
